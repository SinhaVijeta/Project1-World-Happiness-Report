# Project1-World-Happiness-Report
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.
The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.
The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
